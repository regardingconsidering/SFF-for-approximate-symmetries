# SFF-for-approximate-symmetries
This code allows the computation of eigenvalues and spectral form factor (SFF) of matrices with approximate symmetries. These codes were used to produce the numerical results in section 3 of the paper "Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries", arxiv:2405.19260.
